Cigars & Cybernetics (2017-)
Gin & Innovation (2013-2015)

Cigars & Cybernetics is a podcast which I host with Wesley Goatley. We smoke cigars (or consume cigar-type objects) and talk with our guests about systems, technologies, and aesthetics. Our guests have included Ramon Amaro and Lydia Nicholas.

The creation of C&C was influenced by Gin & Innovation, a podcast which I hosted with Justin Pickard, in which we drank gin and talked with our guests about socio-technical systems and recent events. G&I ran from 2013-2015, and our guests included Warren Ellis, James Bridle, Eleanor Saitta, Deb Chachra, Dan Williams, and Scott Smith.
