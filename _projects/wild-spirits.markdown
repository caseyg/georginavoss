**Wild Spirits** was created for the [Uncertainty Playground exhibition](http://uncertaintyplayground.com/) in [London Design Festival 2017](http://www.londondesignfestival.com/), London College of Communication.

Wild Spirits is a wall piece comprised of material drawn from the trade publications XBIZ, Adult Video News, and AVNonline, and ephemera collected from trade shows. The piece traces the messy relationship between the pornography industry and emergent technologies through the industryâ€™s own material, narratives, and in-jokes.
