Wild Spirits was created for Uncertainty Playground, London Design Festival 2017, London College of Communication. 

Wild Spirits is a wall piece comprised of material drawn from the trade publications XBIZ, Adult Video News, and AVNonline, and ephemera collected from trade shows. The piece traces the messy relationship between the pornography industry and emergent technologies through the industryâ€™s own material, narratives, and in-jokes.

This work was commissioned for the Possible/Probable Worlds show in the Uncertainty Playground exhibition, and was constructed to mirror and respond to the steel Voros Cone at the centre of the show.
