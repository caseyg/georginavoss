The Mare Island Extension Kit was created as part of the Situation Systems project in Autodeskâ€™s Experimental Research Lab, Pier 9, San Francisco. It was exhibited at Pier 9 in June 2016; in the Situated Systems speculative exhibition; and as an online distributed work.







Following its closure and decommissioning in 1996, the contents of Mare Island Naval Shipyard (MINS), Vallejo, Northern California were auctioned off to the public in 2002. The heavy industrial machine tools that had previously been utilized to build and repair warships and submarines moved into new hands and new uses across the Bay Area.

Drawing on a print-out of the original auction catalogue, I tracked down three of these machines - a Bridgeport Drill Press; a combined grinder; a bandsaw - and their new operators. Photogrammetry techniques and digital fabrication processes were used to capture them, allowing these large and complex machines to be seen, handled and reproduced beyond the specific workshop environments where they are used. Grey resins - the only colour of material available for use in the fabricators used to construct the Kit - mimic the aesthetics of classic war toys.

The Mare Island Extension Kit extends our conception of warfare beyond the battlefield to consider the role of industrial machinery, construction, and maintenance in military spaces; and highlights the many contexts in which military tools exist over their lifespan.
