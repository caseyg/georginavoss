I’m an anthropologist of technology and innovation systems, artist, writer, and journalist. I’m based in London.

In my work, I examine the political and cultural forces that shape large and complex technologies, and the industrial systems which make them. I do this through installations, objects, films, talks, and research projects. I’m particularly interested in heavy engineering, machinery, and infrastructure; deviance and stigma; and ephemera.

My artwork and installations [link to internal page] have been exhibited in Europe, United Kingdom, and North America, and been commissioned by bodies including Brighton Digital Festival; Milton Keynes International Festival; London Design Festival; Somerset House; Future Flux Festival, Rotterdam; NESTA; and the Open University. I have been a resident at Lighthouse Arts, Brighton; Experimental Research Lab, Pier 9, Autodesk, San Francisco; and RAMLAB, Port of Rotterdam.

My writing [link to internal page] on technology and politics has appeared in online, print, and academic publications including The Atlantic, HOLO, Wired, BBC Futures, Science as Culture, Sexualities, and many others; and I have been a regular contributor to The Guardian’s Political Science section. 

I’m a Founding Member and Director of the research and design studio Strange Telemetry . We’re based at Somerset House, and use critical and speculative design approaches to explore the contexts in which technologies and imagined, built, used, and deployed.

I’m currently a Senior Lecturer and Subject Lead in Critical Studies and Design at the London College of Communication, University of the Arts London; and a guest lecturer and critic at institutions including Goldsmiths; Royal College of Art; Architectural Association; School for Poetic Computation, New York; and Arts Academy, Split. I was awarded my PhD in Science and Technology Studies by SPRU, University of Sussex, which investigated how stigma shaped the industrial dynamics of the adult entertainment industry, and patterns of technological innovation.
